# ðŸ“š So Long  

`So Long` is a graphical game created using C programming. It uses the `MinilibX` library to create a window and interact with basic graphical elements, such as walls, floors, collectibles, and a player character. The game involves navigating through a maze, collecting items, and reaching an exit.  

## ðŸ›  Features  

### Core Features
- **Player Movement**: Move the player character using keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D).
- **Collectibles**: Collect items that are placed in the game world.
- **Exit**: Find the exit after collecting all collectibles.
- **Map Validation**: The game map is validated to ensure it meets the necessary conditions, such as proper boundaries and valid characters.
  
### Game Mechanics  
- **Walls**: Solid obstacles the player cannot pass through.
- **Floor**: The traversable space for the player to move.
- **Collectibles**: Items that the player can collect to complete the level.
- **Exit**: The player must reach the exit after collecting all the required items.

### Validations
- **Map Format**: Ensures the map file has the `.ber` extension.
- **Map Completeness**: Validates the map to ensure all areas are accessible, with no holes or disconnected parts.
- **Valid Characters**: The map must only contain certain valid characters (walls, floor, player, collectible, and exit).
- **Rectangular Map**: Ensures the map is rectangular and all lines are of equal length.
